# 4.![Developing Applications with Cloud Run Functions on Google Cloud](https://storage.googleapis.com/cloud-training/T-DVFUNC-I/v1.0.0/od/en/M0_Course_Introduction.pdf)

Cloud Run functions is an event-driven, serverless compute platform.

There are two types of Cloud Run functions: _HTTP functions_, which handle HTTP requests, and _Event-driven functions_, which handle events from your cloud environment.

## ![Cloud Run Function](https://storage.googleapis.com/cloud-training/T-DVFUNC-I/v1.0.0/od/en/M1_Introduction_to_Cloud_Run_Functions.pdf)
Cloud Run functions is a fully managed serverless execution environment on Google Cloud for you to build, deploy, and run functions.
It is a scalable functions-as-a-service platform, where there is no need to provision any infrastructure or manage individual servers.
There are two versions of Cloud Run functions: Cloud Run functions, formerly known as Cloud Functions (2nd generation), which deploys your functions as services on Cloud Run, allowing you to trigger them using Eventarc and Pub/Sub. Cloud Run functions (1st generation), formerly known as Cloud Functions (1st generation), the original version of functions with limited event triggers and configurability. Cloud Run works well with other services on Google Cloud, so you can build full-featured applications without spending too much time operating, configuring, and scaling your Cloud Run service. A cloud function is simple code that you write that serves a single piece of functionality. Cloud functions execute in a fully managed serverless environment.

### Triggering Functions
Triggers can be HTTP(S) requests or one of several supported cloud events. There are two categories of triggers: HTTP triggers, which react to HTTP(S) requests, and correspond to HTTP

#### Enable Cloud Run Functions to run in response to
1. HTTP(S) request
2. Cloud events
#### HHTP triggers
1. React to HTTP(S) request
2. Correspond to HTTP function
#### Event triggers
1. React to cloud events
2. Correspond to event driven functions
#### Supported triggers
1. Eventarc for event delivery.
2. Additional triggers (Cloud logging, cloud scheduler, cloud tasks, Gmail)

#### Trigger category
1. Cloud Run Function (1st Gen): HTTP, Pub/Sub, Cloud Storage, Firestore, Firebase
2. Cloud Run Function: HTTP, Pub/Sub, Cloud Storage Firestore, Eventarc(90+ event sources)

## Connecting cloud run functions with workflows
Workflows is a fully-managed, serverless orchestration platform that executes services in an order that you define (a workflow).

You use Serverless VPC Access to connect Cloud Run functions directly to your VPC network. A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network is a virtual version of a physical network, implemented inside Google's production network. It’s a global resource that consists of a list of regional virtual subnetworks (subnets) in data centers, all connected by a global wide area network. With Serverless VPC Access, you can connect Cloud Run functions directly to your VPC network, and enable access to Compute Engine VM instances, Memorystore, and other resources with an internal IP address.

## ![Securing Cloud Run Function](https://storage.googleapis.com/cloud-training/T-DVFUNC-I/v1.0.0/od/en/M3_Securing_Cloud_Run_Functions.pdf)
You secure access to Cloud Run functions with identity-based access controls and network-based access controls.

###  Protecting functions and data
You can use Cloud Key Management Service (KMS) to create and manage encryption keys that protect your Cloud Run functions and related data at rest.
The keys are known as customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) and are owned by you and not controlled by Google. They can be stored as software keys, in an HSM cluster, or externally.

### Integrating functions with cloud database
You can integrate Cloud Run functions with: Firestore, Cloud SQL, Spanner, Bigtable, BigQuery, and with Memorystore, Google Cloud’s in-memory cache service.
