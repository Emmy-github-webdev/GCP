## Getting Started with Google Cloud Development

Google Cloud provides many platforms that you can use to build your applications. Your apps can benefit from many powerful services provided by Google Cloud. In this module, you learn how to access these services for your apps and scripts. You learn about Cloud APIs and the Google Cloud SDK, which let you programmatically include these features in your apps.

### Cloud APIs and the Google Cloud SDK

Cloud APIs and the Google Cloud SDK are used to interact with Google services. _Cloud APIs_ provide programmatic interfaces to Google Cloud services. You can use a Google Cloud resource or service in your application by calling a corresponding Cloud API. Cloud APIs let you use powerful features like compute, networking, storage, and machine learning in your applications. Cloud APIs can be called by using HTTP requests with JavaScript Object Notation, or JSON, payloads. They can also be called by using Google Remote Procedure Call, or gRPC, requests. To call Cloud APIs, the caller must supply application credentials.
<br>
The _Google Cloud SDK_ is used to interact with Google Cloud products and services. The SDK features are in two categories: command-line tools and language-specific Cloud Client Libraries. These tools and libraries use Cloud APIs to communicate with Google Cloud.

### Google Clod CLI

The Google Cloud Command Line Interface, or gcloud CLI, provides tools to manage Google Cloud services from the command line or in automated scripts. These tools provide the functionality of the Cloud APIs in an easy-to-use command-line interface.

Command line tools includes: _gcloud_ interacts with Google Cloud services, _gsutil_ manages Cloud Storage buckets and objects, and _bq_ runs queries and manages data in BigQuery. _gcloud storage_ performs better than gsutil, and its usage is similar to other gcloud commands.

### Cloud Client Libraries

Using a Cloud Client Library is easier than making direct API calls. The Cloud Client Libraries are the recommended method for accessing Google Cloud resources from your applications. The Cloud Client Libraries provide an optimized developer experience by handling low-level communication with the server, including authentication.

### Cloud Shell and Cloud Code

Cloud Shell is a free admin machine with browser-based command-line access that is used from the Google Cloud console. It provides you with a temporary virtual machine instance that has 5 GB of persistent disk storage.
You can use Cloud Code to help you develop your cloud applications in your favorite integrated development environment, or IDE. Cloud Code is a set of IDE plugins that make it easier to create, deploy, and debug cloud applications for Google Cloud. Cloud Code is available for the Cloud Shell Editor, Visual Studio Code, and the JetBrains IDEs, which include IntelliJ for Java and PyCharm for Python development.
<br>
Cloud Code for Kubernetes lets you develop your Kubernetes applications in your IDE. Cloud Code's Kubernetes Explorer provides you with an easy way to visualize and manage your Kubernetes resources within the IDE.
<br>
Cloud Workstations provides fully managed and secure cloud-based development environments for Google Cloud. Instead of requiring your developers to install software and run setup scripts, you can create a workstation configuration that specifies your environment in a reproducible way. evelopers can access fast and consistent development environments anytime and anywhere, using a browser, SSH, or a local IDE.
