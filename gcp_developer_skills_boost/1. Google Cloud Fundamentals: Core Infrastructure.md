# Core Infrastructure

Google services can be categorised as
1. Compute
2. Storage
3. Big Data
4. Machine Learning
5. Application services

## Cloud computing
Cloud computing is a way of using information technology that has this five equally important traits
1. Customers get computing resources that are on-demand and self-service
2. Customers get access to those resources over the internet, from anywhere
3. The provider of those resources allocates them to users out of that pool
4. Resources are elastic-which means they are flexible, so customers can be
5. Customers pay only for what yhey use, or reserve as they go.

### IaaS and PaaS

_IaaS: Infrastructure as a service offerings provide:
1. Raw compute
2. Storage
3. Network capabilities

_PaaS: Platform as a service offerings provide: bind code libraries to the infrastructure that the application needs. App engine is an example of PaaS.

In IaaS model, customer pay for what they allocated, while in PaaS model, customer pay for what they actually use.

Serverless services provided by google includes
1. _Cloud Run_: deploy containerized microservices based application in a fully managed environement
2. _Cloud Run Functions_: Manages event-driven code as a pay-as-you-go service

### The Google Cloud Network

It is based in 5 basic geographic locations: _North America_, _South America_, _Europe_, _Asia_, and _Austrilia_.
<br>
App location affects Availibility, Durability, and Latency

### Security - Google infrastructure security
1. Hardware infrastructure layer provides hardware design and provenance, secure boot stack, and premises security
2. Service deployment layer provides encryption of inter-service communication
3. User identity layer provide user identity
4. Storage service layer provides encryption at rest
5. Internet communication layer provides Google Front End (GFE), and Denial of service (DOS) protection
6. Operational Security layer provides intrusion dtection, reducing insider risk, employee universal second factor (U2F) use, and software development practices
