# Service Orchestration and Choreography on Google Cloud
In the Service Orchestration and Choreography on Google Cloud course, learn how the orchestration and choreography patterns can be used to coordinate service communication, and how four managed services provided by Google Cloud can streamline the process.

## MICROSERVICE
Microservices are an alternative, decentralized approach to decomposing applications into services. Microservices are separate services, limited in scope. A microservice specifies an interface, typically an API, that is used by other services when calling the operations of the microservice. The separation of microservices tends to lead to loose coupling between the microservices. Loosely coupled services are easier to maintain, update, and deploy. One of the most difficult parts of architecting a new microservices application is designing the service boundaries.
### Benefits of Microservice
1. Simpler than the large, monolithic application.
2. Each microservice has a smaller and simpler codebase, which generally allows for a single, small team to focus on the internal details of that microservice.
3. Microservices are typically easier to unit test, because there are clear boundaries between different services.
4. Microservices are also separately deployable, which allows teams to update their microservices on their own schedules.
5. These traits of microservices lead to more agile development, because microservices can be separately updated and deployed without affecting other services.
6. Another benefit is that microservices can use different programming languages and technologies.
7. 
Microservices running on one platform can also connect to microservices running on a different platform.
8. Microservices, which typically connect using HTTP APIs, can call each other without worrying about where the service is located.
### Challenges of Microservice
1. More operational skill is required
2. Automated builds, testing, and deployments are vital
3. Consistent logging, reporting, security, and authorization must be maintained
4. Microservices can also introduce communication latency
5. Integration testing is difficult
